## Initial Planning (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Project Requirements Review
- Reviewed the PRD for the Cookie Copy & Fetch Chrome extension
- Confirmed primary goal: Create a personal-use Chrome extension for copying cookies and optionally making API calls
- Established project structure and workflow documentation

### Key Decisions
- Will use Manifest V3 for Chrome extension compatibility
- Will implement both cookie copy and API fetch functionality as specified in PRD
- Project will focus on personal use case, maintaining simplicity

### Questions & Answers
**Q: What permissions will the extension need?**  
A: At minimum: "cookies", "activeTab", and host permissions for API calls

**Q: Should we implement storage for frequent API endpoints?**  
A: Not initially, as the PRD specifies keeping the project lightweight without persistent storage

### Next Steps
- Set up initial project structure
- Create manifest.json with required permissions
- Implement basic popup UI

---

## Implementation (2023-03-21)

### Work Completed
- Created project directory structure
- Implemented manifest.json with required permissions
- Created popup UI with HTML, CSS (green and orange theme as requested)
- Implemented cookie retrieval and copying functionality
- Added API fetch capability with response display
- Created a minimal background service worker
- Added README with installation and usage instructions

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Used a clean, modern UI with clear visual feedback for actions
- Implemented async/await pattern for all API calls
- Added detailed error handling throughout
- Structured CSS with variables for easy theming

### Questions & Answers
**Q: What color scheme should be used?**  
A: Green and orange as requested by the developer

**Q: Should the extension be designed for specific domains?**  
A: No, it should work with any domain as it's for personal use

### Next Steps
- Test the extension with various websites
- Make any necessary adjustments based on testing
- Finalize the UI and functionality

## UI Simplification & Cookie Retrieval Improvements (2023-03-21)

### Work Completed
- Simplified the UI to focus solely on cookie copying functionality
- Removed the manual method instructions section
- Removed the API test functionality as it will be tested externally in Postman and n8n
- Improved cookie retrieval logic to get all available cookies
- Enhanced domain matching to include parent domains

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Modified the cookie retrieval to get all cookies and filter by domain
- Changed host permissions to "<all_urls>" for broader access
- Streamlined the UI for a focused, single-purpose experience
- Increased the height of the cookie textarea for better visibility

### Testing Observations
- Original implementation missed some cookies due to domain filtering
- New implementation captures more cookies by checking domain relationships

### Next Steps
- Final testing across various websites
- Consider any additional cookie matching improvements if needed

## Search Functionality Addition - 2023-03-25

### Work Completed
- Added search and filter functionality for cookies
- Implemented saved keys feature for frequently used cookie names
- Added individual cookie value copying

### Key Implementation Decisions
- Created a separate search section in the UI
- Used localStorage to persist saved keys between sessions
- Maintained original all-cookies copy functionality at the top
- Enhanced cookie display to show both key and value pairs in search results

### Technical Implementation
- Used JavaScript filter() for cookie name searching
- Implemented click handlers for saved keys and copy buttons
- Added status indicators for successful copying operations

### Next Steps
- Final testing across major browsers and sites
- Further UI refinements
- Potential to add search by value in addition to key

## UI Streamlining - 2023-03-25

### Work Completed
- Removed saved keys functionality

- Adjusted UI spacing and dimensions

### Key Implementation Decisions

- Reduced the overall UI height for a more compact popup

### Technical Implementation
- Removed savedKeys-related code from JavaScript
- Simplified HTML structure
